Unmaintained repository
=======================
This repository (*rpn-calculator*) is **intentionally** abandonned and left
unmaintained for good.  To address `Issue #1`_, I have rewritten the entire code
base from scratch, added more features and functionalities, and uploaded the
rewritten calculator as a new project in `a new repository`_ called
*troff-calculator*.
Everything there is a *superset* of everything here, which means that all the
features in this calculator are there, along with additional features that do
not exist here.
New features that do not exist here include the ability to evaluate infix
expressions.

Please do not focus development efforts on this repository any longer;
it is just here for historical reasons.
